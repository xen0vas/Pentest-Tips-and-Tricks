## Mona Tool in Imunity Debugger 
-------------------------------------

#### Create an output folder for mona inside logs folder

```
!mona config -set workingfolder c:\logs\%p
```

#### The command creates the file c:\logs\<executable_name>\pattern.txt with the cyclic pattern inside

```
!mona pc 6000
```

#### shows the distance to the four bytes that control EIP, in the log window of Immunity.

```
!mona pattern_offset <offset> (where <offset> is the value of EIP at the crash time)
```

#### the command below offers the following

##### - Looking for cyclic pattern in memory
##### - Examining SEH chain
##### - Examining stack (entire stack) - looking for cyclic pattern
##### - Examining stack (entire stack) - looking for pointers to cyclic pattern

```
!mona findmsp
```

#### This command tells mona.py to search for an instruction to jump to ESP inside the process binary and the DLLs loaded in memory on execution time (by default it looks in all DLLs loaded in memory; we can use the -m switch to make it search in DLLs passed as parameters). The result is stored in the file c:\logs\<executable_name>\jmp.txt.

```
!mona jmp -r ESP
```

#### create the byte array

```
!mona bytearray
```
